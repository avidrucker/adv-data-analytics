Once upon a time, there were 11 princes who liked to dance. The princes had a father and he was king of the land. The king wasn't so good at dancing, and was embarassed to say so. So, one day, the king asked the king's best soldier, "Soldier, can you teach me how to dance?" The soldier answered, "Yes, your highness, I can." And they lived happily ever after.
